"In this thrilling game inspired by 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,' you'll face a challenge of intellect and nerve across seven exciting levels of questions. With four options for each question, you must choose wisely to progress. Every correct answer brings you closer to winning a substantial amount of money.

Just like the iconic TV show, the rules remain the same. You have two invaluable lifelines at your disposal: 'Ask the Audience,' which lets you tap into the collective wisdom of the crowd, and '50-50,' a lifeline that eliminates two incorrect options, leaving you with a better chance to pick the right one.

The best part? You can opt to quit the game at any point and take the money you've earned, but the question remains: how far are you willing to go? With this thrilling game of strategy, wits, and risk, you have the chance to experience the excitement of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' from the comfort of your own home. Are you ready to step into the hot seat and prove that you've got what it takes to become a virtual millionaire?"
